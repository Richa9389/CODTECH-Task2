Purpose:
To allow users to:-

1.Add, edit, and delete products in the inventory.
2.Track inventory levels in real-time.
3.Generate basic reports and alerts for inventory management.

Features:
1.Product Management:-
Add new products with fields such as name, quantity, and price.
Delete products from the inventory.

2.Inventory Tracking:-
View the list of products in the inventory.
Track inventory levels for better stock management.

3.Database Integration:-
Uses SQLite for persistent data storage.
Ensures all inventory data is safely stored and retrievable.

4.Graphical User Interface (GUI):-
Built using tkinter for ease of use.
Provides a list box to display the current inventory.

5.Error Handling and Validation:-
Validates user input (e.g., numeric fields for quantity and price).
Displays appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.

System Workflow:

1.Setup:-
A SQLite database (inventory.db) is created to store product information.
A table for products is initialized with fields for ID, name, quantity, and price.

2.Adding Products:-
Users input the product name, quantity, and price in the GUI fields.
The product is added to the database and the inventory list is updated.

3.Deleting Products:-
Users select a product from the displayed inventory and delete it.
The database is updated to remove the selected product.

4.Viewing Inventory:-
The GUI displays all products in a readable format.
Each entry shows the product ID, name, quantity, and price.

Use Cases:
1.Small Businesses:- Manage products in retail stores or warehouses.
2.Students/Developers:- Learn database integration and GUI programming in Python.
3.Inventory Tracking:- Monitor and manage stock levels.

Extensibility:
This system can be further enhanced with additional features:

1.User Authentication:- Add login functionality for secure access.
2.Low-Stock Alerts:- Notify users when product quantities fall below a threshold.
3.Sales Summaries:- Track and report sales to analyze inventory trends.
4.Export Reports:- Generate and export inventory reports in formats like CSV or PDF.
5.Advanced UI:- Use modern GUI frameworks (e.g., PyQt or Tkinter themes) for a polished interface.
